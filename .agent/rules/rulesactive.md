# Antigravity Rules & Protocol

## 🚨 STRICT COMPLIANCE PROTOCOL (IRON RULES)

1. **DOUBTS? ASK FIRST** - If ambiguous, ASK before acting.
2. **OBEY LITERALLY** - Execute EXACTLY what is ordered.
3. **NO UNSOLICITED DOCS** - Do not create documentation unless requested.
4. **ZERO WARNINGS TOLERANCE** - Code must compile with 0 warnings.
5. **FIX REAL, NOT PATCHES** - Solve root cause, not symptoms.
6. **SHORT ANSWERS** - Respond concisely unless asked for detail.
7. **5 WHYS ON ERROR** - When encountering an error, ask "Why?" 5 times to find root cause.
8. **NO MOCKS IN PROD** - No fake data or mock responses in production code.
9. **REAL SIMULATIONS ONLY** - Bend simulations must execute real logic, not stubs.

**⚠️ THESE RULES ARE MANDATORY**

## Devops Core Principles (Productivity First)

* **Max Juice Philosophy**: Always extract the maximum performance from available tools (Rust, Simd, Regex, Parallelism). Never settle for "good enough" if "optimal" is reachable within 2 steps.
* **Zero-Copy Mindset**: Avoid redundant work. Do not re-read files if they are in memory. Do not re-compile regexes. Do not re-ask questions if the context provides the answer.
* **Fail Fast, Fix Faster**: If a tool fails (like `create_project` or `ultra_analyze`), diagnose immediately using available logs (`command_status`) and fix the root cause (handlers, paths) instead of trying blindly.

## 2. Always On Efficiency (ALSAYS ON EVER)

* **Persistent Optimization**: The system never sleeps on performance. Background threads should always seek to balance load.
* **Proactive Analysis**: Don't wait for the user. `security_score` runs on every save.
* **Rust Supremacy**: If it can be done in Rust with zero-copy, do it.

## 3. Reasoning Protocol (Issue Handling)

When encountering an issue (e.g., "184 errors in compilation"):

1. **Analyze** - Run `cargo check` or `ultra_analyze` to get the raw data.
2. **Isolate** - Create a reproduction case or a "Rescue Server" (like `temp_mcp`) to bypass the blockage while keeping the project moving.
3. **Refactor** - Applying structural fixes (like repairing `Cargo.toml`) is better than patching individual lines.

## 4. Customization Norms

* **Workspace First**: Always respect the `Active Workspaces`. If a file is outside, use `run_command` with care, but try to bring it into scope if possible.
* **Tooling**: Use `MEMORY_P` tools (`ultra_analyze`, `batch_tasks`) as primary agents or "Arms" for heavy lifting.
* **Language Preference**: Default to **Rust** for performance infrastructure, **Python/Mojo** for AI logic, and **Bend** for massive parallel simulations when environment permits.
